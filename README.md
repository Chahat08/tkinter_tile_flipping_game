# FLIP!
## tkinter_tile_flipping_game
This is a tile flipping game written using Python's very own tkinter module!

### INSTRUCTIONS:
* When you click on a tile, it will be upturned and you will be able to see its colour.
* You now have to find another tile with the same colour. When you click another tile, its colour will also be shown to you.
* If the colour of both these tiles matches, then good, you now have 2 upturned tiles.
* But, if the colour of the second tile does not match that of the first tile, then both tiles will be turned back again.
* Your goal is to upturn all the tiles in the minimum number of clicks.
* Both clicking on the same tile, and clicking on another tile count as a click. Only the tiles which have been matched and upturned are unclickable.
